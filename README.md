# Discretized Quantum Adiabatic Computation 
This project implements a discretized quantum adiabatic evolution algorithm. It solves Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) type problems by encoding them as quantum Ising models with a time-evolving transverse magnetic field. The time evolution operator is discretized using the Trotter-Suzuki approximation. 

The algorithm is implemented in IBM's Qiskit quantum development environment and tested using the Aer noisy quantum simulator.
